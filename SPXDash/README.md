# SPX Dashboard 

## https://blanierspx.herokuapp.com/

This dashboard is an amalgamation of many different metrics and graphs related to options that I found interesting.  
The most useful chart is the 5th one (second from the bottom).  I have found that being able to visualize the volume and open interst of options, especially when combined with thier respective greeks, gives one insight to the market maker hedging that will occur as options go into expiration.  This idea mostly came from this paper here https://squeezemetrics.com/download/The_Implied_Order_Book.pdf
