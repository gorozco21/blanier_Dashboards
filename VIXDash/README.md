# VIX Dashboard 

## http://blaniervix.herokuapp.com/

The VIX is the volatility index of the S&P500 index.  Commonly called the "fear index", it is an attempt to generally quantify the expected move on the index.  Given that large moves on the index are disproportionately to the downside, it makes sense that people would refer to the VIX as the "fear index", though its inner working and interpretation can be quite a bit more complicated than that.  

The goal of this dashboard was to allow for an interactive view of realized, historical volatility on the index, and compare it to the "estimated" volatility by the VIX index at the time.  You will see more often than not, the VIX is higher than the realized volatility - meaning there is a chronic premium for volatility, that the market always seems to be willing to pay. 

The idea for this comparison comes from this blog post http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/spread-between-vix-and-20-day.html
